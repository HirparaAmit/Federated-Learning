## Federated Learning Mechanism for Tweet Sentiment Analysis

`Federated LSTM.ipynb` contains the complete code of federated learning mechanism to predict the sentiment of given tweet.

ðŸ‘‰ For this particular problem statement, I have used LSTM architecture. Basically this file contains the comparison between server based learning (normal training algorithm) and federated learning algorithm. For theboth of the learning mechanism, I ahve used same LSTM architecture.

ðŸ‘‰ I have also presented the research paper regarding this topic. If you want to read it then [Click Here!](https://www.worldresearchlibrary.org/up_proc/pdf/5513-167644505520-29.pdf)
